#🔥 Hot or Cold? The Ultimate Hunt Game

Welcome to the Hot or Cold Game—a simple yet addictive guessing game where you hunt for a hidden point on the screen by following temperature clues!
🎮 How to Play

    When the game starts, a hidden red dot is randomly placed within the play area.
    Move your cursor around and pay attention to the feedback:
        Hot!: You’re getting closer to the target.
        Cold!: You’re moving away from the target.
        Stable: You’re near the target, but not quite on it.
    Objective: Once you think you’ve found the spot, click on it to win the game!

Test your skills and see how fast you can find the point. But be quick—can you stay cool under pressure?
